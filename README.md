# Digabi Skaba Wordpress Plugin

## Overview

Digabi Skaba is a Wordpress Plugin with following functions:

1. Creates web form for submitting a contest entry. The form will be created
   for short code [digabi_skaba_form].
2. Processed form submissions. Creates a post for each submission. The
   featured image is created by Bluga.net website thumbnail service
   (http://webthumb.bluga.net/).
3. The user's email is stored to meta variable "digabi_skaba_email". Currently
   there is no user-friendly way to read the values. These must be read directly
   from the database.
